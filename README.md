# Seedr

This small React app serves a purpose of generating fake seed data for Rails backend.

Here it is deployed: https://seedr.netlify.app/

Technologies used: 
- Create React App
- Styled Components - styling and theme provision with react context
- React-Select - for providing user with option based on the api response

I used fakejson.com for content.
